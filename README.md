# Hospital-Management
Created a Hospital Management System website using HTML, CSS &amp; PHP. One can book appointments from the website itself and only the admin can see the list of all the appointments, doctors and the departments.
I've used XAMPP web-server.

BEFORE OPERATING THE WEBSITE:
	1: INSTALL THE 'AR BONNIE' FONT FILE.
	2: CREATE DB(s) FROM THE 'SQL' TXT FILE.
